== Connect to Database

To connect to PostgreSQL you need to use psql, which is a terminal-based front-end to PostgreSQL.
It enables you to type in queries interactively, issue them to PostgreSQL, and see the query results.

=== a. Locating psql:
PostgreSQL is supported on three major platforms. To connect using psql you will first need to locate its location on
the operating system that you might be using:

==== i. On Linux:
The easiest way to connect is to check whether you already have psql in your environment variables on not.
You can try the following command on the terminal:
----
[root@localhost data]# which psql
/usr/bin/psql
----

This gives you the path, and also, since the OS knows the location, you will not need to browse for it. However,
if it errors out, you can locate the psql utility by searching for the file with the following command on terminal:
----
[root@localhost /]# find / -name psql
/usr/edb/as11/bin/psql
----

==== ii. On Windows:
On Windows, you can find psql in the Program Files, and you should be able to launch it in a command prompt simply by
clicking on it.

==== iii. On Mac:
On a Mac you should be able to locate psql under the Applications > PostgreSQL (version number) > SQL Shell (psql).

=== b. Connecting psql:
Now that we have located psql, we need to understand what it requires to connect to the database.
The basic parameters on any of the platforms are as follows:

==== Server [localhost]:
This is the address for the server. You can use an IP address or the hostname of the machine on which database
server is running. If you do not give any value, by default it is localhost.

==== Database [postgres]:
The name of the database with which you want to connect. The default name of the database is the same as that
of the user. (If you are using Advanced Server, the default name would be edb.)

==== Port [5432]:
This is the port on which you have configured your instance while installing or initializing.
The default port is 5432. (If you are using Advanced Server this would be 5444.)

==== Username [postgres]:
This is the username that is created while the installation takes place. The default username for postgres is postgres.
(If you are using Advanced Server it is enterprisedb.)

On a Mac or Windows, you are able to connect to the default instance by simply hitting enter at the shell or
command prompt when trying to run psql and keying in the password.

On Linux, you will explicitly need to pass these parameters at the shell:

For PostgreSQL:
----
-bash-4.2$ psql -d postgres -U postgres
----
For Advanced Server:
----
-bash-4.2$ psql -d edb -U enterprisedb
----
If connecting to a remote server from any of the operating systems, you can pass on the specific parameters in the
following format:
----
bash-4.2$ psql -h <hostname or ip address> -p <port number of remote machine> -d <database name which you want to connect> -U <username of the database server>
----

== Run the Application

To run the application, run the following command in a terminal window (in the `complete`)
directory:
----
gradlew bootRun -Pargs="--server.port=8181"
----
